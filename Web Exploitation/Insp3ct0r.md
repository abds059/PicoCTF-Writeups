# Insp3ct0r

Here Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: 
[website link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/)

So we are going to dig deeper into the code by searching for the flag 

## Steps

- First we open the given [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/)
- Then we `Right Click` and `Inspect` and go to sources to inspect the available code files 
OR we can press `Ctrl + Shift + I` to directly go to the sources tab
- Here we first inspect the HTML code in `9670/` named file where we can easily locate a comment containing the first part of the flag

- For the second part of the flag visit the `mycss.css` file and locate the second part flag in the comment down below

- Similarly the final part of the flag will be available in the `myjs.js` file

**Combine the three parts together and submit the flag!**
