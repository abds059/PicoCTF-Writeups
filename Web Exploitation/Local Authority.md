# Local Authority

Here we were given a web page with login form and we had to inspect the behaviour of the webpage to find the required flag

## Steps
- After launching the instance a web link appears in the challenge description
- After routing to the web page press `Ctrl + Shift + I` to view the the page source files

- Intitially there are two file `(index) and style.css` both of them have nothing related to flag
- Try filling out the form with any arbitrary values for the name and password fields (like try out **admin with password 123**)
- Upon hitting submit button a new file named `secure.js` will appear in the source files

- Upon inspecting the `secure.js` file we find that the username required is **"admin"** and the required password **"strongPassword098765"**


- Reload the web page and enter these credentials to login
- Upon pressing the submit button the flag will be visible on the web page 

- Also on the sources tab you can see an `admin.php` file appear which can also be inspected to view the same flag in its code
